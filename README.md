## Overview

At [Rootle.space](https://rootle.space/), we'll recommend small businesses for you to try out! Select a business you'd like to find smaller alternatives to, or simply query what tags you're looking for, and we'll show you what's local. Help out your community and root for the small guys!

## How we promote smaller businesses

Rootle is built on the underlying assumption that popular businesses have more reviews on review sites, and thus receive more attention than their smaller counterparts (whose main form of advertising often comes from word of mouth). Think Whole Foods vs. your local mom-and-pop, or Denny's vs. the diner down the street-- the disparity's pretty clear. Our website aims to combat this. Using a skewed random distribution with data from Yelp, our algorithm prioritizes and shines light on the more unrecognized businesses in your community, letting you find these hidden gems!
